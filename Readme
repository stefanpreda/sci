Each test runs 100 times on random character strings
All java optimizations turned off (cannot turn off classloading)
1 test is run outside of 100 loop to take into account class loading time
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jrandtest/ - randomness tests are taken from here
all randomness tests are executed on encrypted strings with 16 characters (256 bytes keys for all except 3DES which has 8 Bytes key)
